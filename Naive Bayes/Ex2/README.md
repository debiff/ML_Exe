In this exercise we use the GaussianNB to train a classifier and classify a new speed regarding the grade/bumpy problem

### Complete the code in ClassifyNB.py with with the sklearn Naive Bayes classifier to classify the terrain data.
We obtain from the teacher the 3 files studentMain.py, class_vis.py, prep_terrain_data.py that in order have the task of:

*put togheter all the classes and the functions of the other files, is the entry point of our program
*is the class needed for plot graph and points
*is the file that create a dataset

### ClassifyNB.py
This file is presentend as follow
```
def classify(features_train, labels_train):   
    ### import the sklearn module for GaussianNB
    ### create classifier
    ### fit the classifier on the training features and labels
    ### return the fit classifier
    
    
    ### your code goes here!
    
```
and we have to apply the notions learned in the Ex1 for create and fit the classifier
